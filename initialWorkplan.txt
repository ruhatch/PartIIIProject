Work plan

  - Explore/understand in Coq/Agda what has been done in the formulation of Category Theory (but it appears to be underdeveloped)
  - If it is as undeveloped as we think, need to start developing the theories of:
    - limits
    - colimits
    - Kan extensions
    - coends (including the calculus)
    - presheaves
    - profunctors
    - species
    - operads (related to species)
    - Lawvere theories
    - abstract syntax
    - free constructions (P and F)
